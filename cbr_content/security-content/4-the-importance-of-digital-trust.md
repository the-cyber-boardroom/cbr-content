title: 4) The importance of digital trust.
---

When an organisation has a strong cybersecurity strategy it is also contributing to its growth strategy. That is because a successful cybersecurity strategy strengthens the digital trust it has with its customers. Digital trust is the confidence users put in people, technology, and processes to provide a digitally secure environment. That confidence needs to be earned and there is no better way to earn it than by demonstrating than an organisation has a strong cybersecurity strategy.

Trust can be an extremely important differentiator. Users and customers want clarity around security, data ethics and privacy. Ultimately what customers want are the values that have defined the very concept of ‘trust’ for centuries: reliability, credibility, and security.

While users understand that there are risks associated with sharing their personal data in exchange for services, they want to minimise that risk. How best to convince them that the risk is indeed very low? By earning their trust with a solid cybersecurity strategy.

Cyber attacks will happen and that is why digital trust needs to be designed into organisations’ digital growth strategies and address systems, processes, and people. Organisations can't afford not to transform digitally, to invest in new technologies. But cyber risk should not stifle innovation or growth ambitions. Cyber crime is an inevitability now and that is why board members need to make balanced decisions based on business priorities and impact. Cybersecurity is essentially part of the 'normalised' business conversation. An integral part of organisation’ business growth strategy and an enabler. A catalyst to thrive in the digital world.
